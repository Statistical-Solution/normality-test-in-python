# Problem statment
Suppose we take data set about an electronics and there is a variable is purchase_intention which reflects our customers intention to buy this product. Therefore, we must evaluate this variable's normality before performing any analysis because many statistical tests, including the t test, anova, regression, and others, depend on the normality assumption being met.

For testing normality we used: <br>
* Visual methods
 * Histogram
 * Q-Q plots

* Statistical test
   * Shapiro-Wilk test
   * Kolmogorov-Smirnov test
 
# Solution

We tried to provide solution when the data did not follow normal distribution.

By doing transformation our data become more normal than original.
